# FlexBox Play

The sections have been divided into individual **css** files which are bound to respective **html** files.  

To make it simple for you, the names for the bounded **css** and **html** files are kept the **same**.  
As an instance, the file **flex-main.css** has all the styling related to **flex-main.html**
